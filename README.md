# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Work Day Scheduler 
Introduction

The Work Day Scheduler was created for Challenge 5 and includes JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, Third Party APIs and CSS files. The Work Day Scheduler includes time blocks from 9am- 5pm in which you can add upcoming events for the current work day. Time blocks in the present will be colored red, time blocks in the past will be colored gray, and time blocks in the future will be colored green. The user can save events within each time block.

Usage 

https://aabare.github.io/scheduler/

Once on the Work Day Scheduler the user clicks in each individual time block, types events happening during each time during the day and then saves events during the work day(9am-5pm). As the work day progresses the time blocks in the past change to gray. If the event is during a present time the time block will be red indicating that it is a currently happening event. Future events will be colored green to show that they are going to occur.
